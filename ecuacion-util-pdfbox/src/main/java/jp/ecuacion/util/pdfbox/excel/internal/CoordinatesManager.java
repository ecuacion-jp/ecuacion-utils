/**
 * Gives a coordinat-points in two coordinates.
 * 
 * <p>When you create PDF (0, 0) is at the bottom-left point of the page.
 *     The point goes towards the right as the value of x becomes greater
 *     and the point goes towards the top as the value of y becomes greater.</p>
 *
 * <p>On the other hand, when you create a document, you start with top-left of it.
 *     The point wants to go towards the right as the value of x becomes greater
 *     and the point wants to go towards the bottom as the value of y becomes greater.<br>
 *     So coordinates of PDF is not very useful to us.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To resolve that situation we introduce this class 
 *     to translate document-standard coorrdinates to PDF coordinates.</p>
